# BeeWangWifiChat
# Goal:
To create one of the most energy efficient local network chatting program in python a 16 year old can create. 
That consits atleast one server, and two or more clients.

# Dumb stuff:
Have you ever had a friend, who's class is at the opposide side of your school? 
Have you ever wanted to chat in class but you cannot talk?
As long as you all are on the same wifi, you can use this program to talk to each other!
There are no subscription fees! There are no one collecting logs, or spying your conversations!
This is a simple, efficient chatting program (well still in development)!

# Dependencies:
- tkinter (for the GUI)
- threading (for being able to recieve messages and send messages)
- socket (the base of the program, to create TCP connections)

# Apologies!
I have not studied python very deeply or networking very deeply, there could be way more potential to this program, but I just have not
got the skills to discover them.
